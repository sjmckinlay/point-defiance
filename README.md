# point-defiance

This repository contains the pathfinding calculations and visualizations for analysis of hiking paths on Five Mile Drive.

The Excel spreadsheet is the distance matrix for an example park, Five Mile Drive at Point Defiance.  All established trail distances are listed in feet; all cross-country treks are given a distance that is inflated by an arbitrary factor of 120, to discourage algorithms from choosing them as viable paths.
